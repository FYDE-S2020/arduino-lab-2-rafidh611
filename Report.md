## Questions

1. What is the purpose of an IP address?

    IP address is an unique number assigned to each machine connected to a network.

2. What is a DNS? What are the benefits of using domain names instead of IP addresses?

     IP addresses are 32 bits which is very hard to keep track of, so the symbolic names known as DNS are much more recognizable and user friendly.

3. What is the difference between a static IP and a dynamic IP?

    Static IP is when a mchine always keeps the same IP address while dynamic is when the machine changes the address from time to time.

4. What is the tradeoff between UDP and TCP protocols?

    UDP ports provide unreliable best-effort communication while TCP provides reliable guarenteed communcation without losing any information along the way.


5. Why can't we use the delay function with Blynk?

    Blynk is programmed to be event based so having a delay function will break the timing of the system.

6. What does it mean for a function to be "Blocking"?

     Its when a nothing else can run when a specefic line or function is getting run.

7. Why are interrupts useful for writing Non-Blocking code?

    Interrupts lets you pause wherever you are in the code and lets you go take care of other urgent business in the code.


8. What is the difference between interface and implementation? Why is it important?

   Interface tells you how a function is called while implementation tells you what the function does.
